# Learnings and updates from the last code:
### Learnings:
> Babel: 
>> package that handles and perform polyfill(a technique to convert new code to broser compatible code) so that the code can work in older browser.
> `Tree Shaking`: Performed by Parcel(bundlers) which results in removal of unwanted code(unused functions that came up with the libraries) from our project.
